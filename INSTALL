Cygbuild - A porting tool for making Cygwin net releases
--------------------------------------------------------

Install instructions

    Standard install

        The /usr/local is the default install location. Change
	with prefix variable:

	    make help
            make [prefix=/usr] install

	If this is version control checkout, use symlink install:

            make [prefix=/usr] install-symlink

    Running in place

        It is not mandatory to install anything after unpack or
        version control checkout. The program will search needed
        files, provided that a) it is called by absolute name:

	    alias cb="/path/to/cygbuild.sh --color"
	    cb <command ...>

	or b) package's bin/ directory is added to environment
        variable PATH.
