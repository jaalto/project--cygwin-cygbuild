=head1 DESCRIPTION

Program rebuilds all Cygwin Net release packages recursively starting from
directory DIR. The directory structure layout must be same as outlined in
cygbuild.1 manual section 'How to organize Cygwin Net Release
builds'. Basicly, if DIR is /usr/src/cygwin-build/ the expected layout is:

     +--foo/
     |  |
     |  +--foo-1.3/
     |  +--foo-1.4/
     |
     +--bar/
        +--bar-3.12/
    ...

Only the latest directories (like foo-1.4) will be rebuilt.
