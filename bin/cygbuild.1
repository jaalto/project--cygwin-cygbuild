.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This program builds Cygwin binary and source packages. Refer to \fICygwin
Package Contributor's Guide\fR at http://cygwin.com/setup.html for more
information about the details of packaging phase. Due to complex nature of
various source packages out there, it is impossible to completely automate
the packaging steps. Some manual work will always be needed. The hairy
ports are those that have very vague and misbehaving \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR which
install files to all over the system and distribute copies of files with
\&\fIcp\fR\|(1) instead of \fIinstall\fR\|(1). Ahem, you as \*(L"the porter\*(R", know the
drill and have to use your hands to \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR mud tar pit. Solid
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR experience is therefore a requirement before thinking to port
any packages to Cygwin.
.PP
If \fIgpg\fR\|(1) is installed, the patch, binary and source package can be
cryptographically signed. See options \fB\-\-sign\fR and \fB\-\-passphrase\fR.
.SS "Packages with no version number"
.IX Subsection "Packages with no version number"
To port a package which does not have a version number, one has to be
generated out of the blue. Program relies on the fact that the \s-1VERSION\s0
number is included in the original package name and in the unpack
directory. The package extensions can be \f(CW\*(C`*.tar.gz\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*.tar.bz2\*(C'\fR
\&\f(CW\*(C`*.tar.xz\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*.tgz\*(C'\fR. The recognized package file name formats
include:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package\-N[.N]+.tar.gz                Universal packaging format
\&    package_N[.N]+.orig.tar.gz           Debian source packages
.Ve
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    package\-1.2.tar.gz
\&    package\-0.0.2.tar.bz2
\&    package\-12.0.2.1.tgz
.Ve
.PP
The package name can consist of many words separated by hyphens:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package\-name\-long\-N[.N]+.tar.gz         hyphens
\&    package_name_invalid\-N[.N]+.tar.gz      Underscores not allowed
.Ve
.PP
In case file uses some other naming or numbering scheme, it's a
problem. Similarly if the unpack directory structure does not use
universal format \f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N\*(C'\fR, it's a problem. Suppose a package
unpacks like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    tar \-zxvf package\-beta\-latest.tar.gz
\&        ...
\&        package\-latest
\&        package\-latest/src
\&        package\-latest/doc
.Ve
.PP
The situation can be coped by making a symbolic link to whatever is
appropriate for the version number. If unsure, pick a \s-1YYYYMMDD\s0 in case
there is no relevant version that can be used for the package.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    ln \-s package\-beta\-latest.tar.gz package\-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
\&    ln \-s package\-latest/ package\-YYYYMMDD/
.Ve
.PP
It is important that you do all your work inside the directory with \s-1VERSION\s0
number, not in directory \f(CW\*(C`package\-latest/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    cd package\-YYYYMMDD/
\&    ... now proceed with the porting
.Ve
.SS "Packaging directly from version control repositories"
.IX Subsection "Packaging directly from version control repositories"
It is easy to make build snapshots by using symlinks with time based
version numbers, like \f(CW\*(C`package\-20010123\*(C'\fR, which effectively means
\&\s-1YYYYMMDD\s0. To make a release, it could be done like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    cvs \-d :pserver:<remote> co foopackage
\&    date=$(date "+%Y%M%d")
\&    ln \-s foopackage foopackage\-$date
\&    cd foopackage\-$date
\&    ... proceed to package this snapshot

.Ve
.IP "\fBreadmefix\fR" 4

.Sp
Files with  \fI*.tmp\fR extension are ignored.
.IP "\fBfinish\fR" 4

Remove source unpack directory \f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N/\*(C'\fR. This command is
dangerous. It might be better to use \f(CWrm(1)\fR manually.
.Sp
Really, user should never run this command. It is mostly reserved for
internal build process testing command \fB[all]\fR.
.IP "\fBpublish\fR" 4
.IX Item "publish"
If environment variable \f(CW\*(C`CYGBUILD_PUBLISH_BIN\*(C'\fR is set, the external
program is called with 3 mandatory and 2 optional arguments from
options \fB\-\-sign\fR and \fB\-\-passphrase\fR if those were supplied. The

It makes sense to run publish command only after commands

Complex packages that need access to their libraries, Perl/Python
modules or data cannot be tested without live install first. Merely
setting the \s-1PATH\s0 wouuld not be enough, but instead:

7. Building source packages is much harder, because the program needs to
know more details about configure and build phases. If the default source
packaging command \fB[source\-package]\fR does not succeed, you probably have
to guide the process slightly by the shell scripts provided under directory

That's it, if all succeeded. At directory up \f(CW\*(C`./.sinst\*(C'\fR you should see two

package. The \s-1RELEASE\s0 number is the result of the \fB\-r\fR option.

given by setting environment variable \fI\s-1QUILT_PATCHES\s0\fR. In short:
managing multiple quilt instances in separate directories is not

If a Makefile (run by \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR) includes hard coded paths or uses
\&\fIcp\fR\|(1) to copy files, to absolute locations, a custom installation procedure
may be needed. It would also help if the author of the original package were
contacted and suggested that a possible new releases of package would lean
to use \fIinstall\fR\|(1) and Makefile variables. Those could be set externally and
controllable manner.

Does everything look good? No. Documentation appears to be installed twice.
In this case it is due to fact that cybuild.sh always runs it's own default
install for files under package's \f(CW\*(C`doc/\*(C'\fR directory. But if run \*(L"make
install\*(R" also does the same, it's a problem as in this case. The target
directory was just a little different. The documentation must appear in
directory \f(CW\*(C`usr/share/doc/\*(C'\fR and not \f(CW\*(C`usr/doc/\*(C'\fR over, so the
\&\f(CW\*(C`install\-after.sh\*(C'\fR script's work is to remove the extra files:

If you need exotic 'make install' options, this is the place to configure.
For example, if \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR does not use \fI\s-1DESTDIR\s0\fR option, but a variable
\&\fI\s-1INSTALLROOT\s0\fR, you can add that to 'make install' by defining generic
\&\f(CW\*(C`CYGBUILD_MAKEFLAGS\*(C'\fR make option. This works, because variables
\&\f(CW$instdir\fR and \f(CW$PREFIX\fR are set in the program and contain the needed
information.

populated from files in the original package. Those of \s-1INSTALL\s0, \s-1COPYRIGHT\s0

default rules exclude the most common files \s-1MANIFEST\s0, *.bak, *.rej etc. and
version control subdirectories.
.Sp
In this file it is possible to supply extra tar options to exclude more
files not to be included. Perhaps package's \f(CW\*(C`doc/\*(C'\fR directory contains
subdirectories that are targeted to software developers porting the

The first word is a file name or a glob and second optional argument
is manual page section. If file name ends to \f(CW\*(C`*.[1\-8]\*(C'\fR, it is used
for manual page section. Empty lines and comments on their own line

so the site wide configuration file could had come from the last
directory. Let's suppose upstream has put the example in:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /usr/share/doc/package\-1.4/examples/package.conf
.Ve
.Sp
When new version of package is about to be installed by \fIsetup.exe\fR, the

upstream examples listed in <preremove\-manifest\-from.lst> which now can
simply read:

.Ve
.Sp
The special tag \f(CW\*(C`#PKGDOCDIR\*(C'\fR is just a shorthand pointer to the latest

At first sight this may look complex, but with this structure you can
manage several packages easily. For each package, reserve a separate
directory where you do your work: \f(CW\*(C`package/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bar/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`quux/\*(C'\fR etc. Download
original packages to these directories and unpack the sources. Let's examine

.PP
.Vb 2
\&    cd /usr/src/cygwin\-build/package

Sometimes the packages unpacks to an uncommon directory:

Use previously recommended symlink approach to convert the name into more
standard form. Here the 'b' is minor release '2':
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ln \-s package1.4b/ package\-1.4.2/
.Ve

There isn't much to do after that. You do your builds in the unpack
directories as usual. Supposing this is \*(L"standard\*(R" looking \s-1GNU\s0 package

As Cygwin is improved, the main library file \f(CW\*(C`cygwin1.dll\*(C'\fR may change and
periodically all packages must be rebuilt so that they link to the latest
function calls. In this case you have to rebuild every package you
maintain. Instead of going to every directory and typing the relevant
\&\*(L"cygbuild clean conf make install ..\*(R", there is a helper script that
automates the task. If you use the standard build layout as described in
previous topic, you can use rebuild script to do the steps. Is is also a
good chance to verify that the package build process is repeatable:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    cygbuild\-rebuild.sh \-d /usr/src/cygwin\-build \-i 1 2>&1 | tee build.log
\&                         |                       |

If something goes wrong, you have to manually fix the package. Do not run
the rebuild script again until you have fixed the build process for a
broken package.

In addition to \fIcygbuild\fR being a builder program, it can be used as a
library that can be sourced to any bash program. This makes it possible to
selectively use functions from it. The library feature is enabled by setting
variable \f(CW\*(C`CYGBUILD_LIB\*(C'\fR before \f(CW\*(C`source\*(C'\fR command. When invoked this way,
the \fIcygbuild's\fR \f(CW\*(C`Main()\*(C'\fR function in not invoked and options or
commands are bypassed.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1WARNING:\s0\fR While the functions are name space clean and contain
prefix \fBCygbuild*\fR, many global variables are defined that do not
include this prefix. These variables include \f(CW$instdir\fR, \f(CW$builddir\fR
etc.

.SS "Using preremove.sh and postinstall.sh for upgrading /etc files"
.IX Subsection "Using preremove.sh and postinstall.sh for upgrading /etc files"
The \f(CW\*(C`/etc\*(C'\fR directory is meant for configuration files for programs. The first
installation typically copies the package's default setup file there but
subsequent installations won't overwrite existing files in order to
preserve user's modifications. If new version of the package includes new
features, those are not found from the \*(L"old\*(R" \f(CW\*(C`/etc\*(C'\fR configuration files.
.PP
Let's suppose user has not yet modified system wide configuration file
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/package.conf\*(C'\fR and package includes newer one in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/package\-1.2/package.conf.example\*(C'\fR. In this case the installation
should copy the new example file over \f(CW\*(C`/etc/package.conf\*(C'\fR to reflect possible
new features in the program.
.PP
The trick is to include a \fIpreremove.sh\fR script in the Cygwin Net Release
binary package. A file named \f(CW\*(C`/etc/preremove/package.sh\*(C'\fR will be called just
before the package is uninstalled (setup.exe uninstalls the old version
before installing the upgraded version), so in that script, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/package.conf\*(C'\fR exists and is identical to
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/package.conf.example\*(C'\fR, the \fIpreremove.sh\fR should delete it
and let \fIpostinstall.sh\fR install new one. If the \f(CW\*(C`/etc/package.conf\*(C'\fR is
modified, it must be left alone.
.PP
Also, it is a good idea to have a file \f(CW\*(C`/etc/preremove/package\-manifest.lst\*(C'\fR,
which lists every file that was created by the \fIpostinstall.sh\fR script,
and which will be removed on \fIpreremove.sh\fR if untouched by the user.
Someday, \f(CW\*(C`cygcheck \-c\*(C'\fR might parse the manifest lists to help diagnose if
postinstall has not completed.
